                <p class="projectDescription">My programming journey began in the ninth grade when I went to work with my dad for take-your-kid-to-work-day and made my very first application. From there I took Computer Science classes in high school which allowed me to gain fundamental skills in HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Java. This led me to university where I learned C++ and Python and gained invaluable group work experience.</p>
                <p class="projectDescription">I have a passion for user experience and strive to develop meaninful experiences for users. I love being creative and taking on a challenge.</p>
